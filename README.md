# sampan-boxcount
An assignment from Sampan Analytics and Consulting to check the number of boxes in an image.
Done using algorithms for edge detection and contour detection by processing the image. 
Trying two methods, one is image processing(in folder image-processing) and the other one using deep learning (using the ultralytics YOLOV8).
The test1.png is the test image to upload.
